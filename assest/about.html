                NASA’s open data sources hold an abundance of imagery. Mapping that imagery 
                to a digital globe makes the data interactive and may enable people to discover relationships 
                among ecosystem phenomena. Your challenge is to develop a digital globe web-app that

                NASA’s open data sources hold an abundance of imagery. Mapping that imagery to a digital 
                globe makes the data interactive and may enable people to discover relationships among 
                ecosystem phenomena. Using a digital globe, such as NASA’s Web WorldWind, this Space Apps 
                challenge involves developing and deploying an interactive web app that enables exploration.
                A web-app that presents single view of the Earth could present one or more layers of imagery.
                A web-app multiple views of the Earth can provide side-by-side views of two sets of imagery. 
                A few web-apps have already been developed using NASA’s Web WorldWind. Figure 1 presents a screen
                 shot of NASA World. Figure 2 presents a screenshot of Quake Hunter. Both of these web apps were 
                 developed with Web WorldWind.</p></div>

            <p>As technology plays a vital role in today's era and we are becoming digitally active day by day.Here we are showing
                the optimal solution for how the data can be practically utilized.Cosmos is a uniquely interactive map experience 
                accessible to people of all ages. With Cosmos, anyone can explore and engage with science and the Earth. 
                Our acoustic and visual maps generate Data using Datasets provided by NASA and remote sensing data that allow you to interact 
                with our world through atmosphere, land, energy, life and ocean.

            <h1>Our Idea</h1>
            <div><p>It’s natural to wonder about the Earth and Beyond. Satellite maps and remote sensing data help us visualize 
                our planet, but sometimes it’s hard to interpret without being an expert. We add a unique dimension to this 
                data, a more natural and engaging way to interact with it, learn from it, and even discover new insights.</p></div>
           <p>
                We  generate data in real time from nasa datasets while visualizing the results.
                 The visual data are created by the user as they interact with the maps, activating
                  all your senses as you explore the earth in this visceral and unique way. We believe data is
                   beautiful, and we set out to create a new way to experience it!

            <h1>Why it’s Important</h1>
            <div><p>
                    Creating data through Cosmos dynamic Webapp draws in audiences of all kinds, 
                    from art and science enthusiasts to adults and children alike. Exploring data with Cosmos is a 
                    fun, exciting, and engaging new way to learn about the science behind the data, and we hope to
                     get everyone excited about earth sciences, the environment, and the work NASA does to help us
                      understand our place in the world!

                    For families, we picture Cosmos being used to aid in parent child bonding experiences. 
                    Parents can sit down with their children and explain locations, or maps while having fun. 
                    Cosmos also creates new interactions with data for those that may not rely on traditional 
                    ways of experiencing the world.
